`object` - Represent a set of functions (`sync` / `async`) to be called when form actions are processed. Object in resources object.

Example:

```javascript
const resources = {
  // ...
  hooks: {
    afterInit: ({ model, resources metadata, type }) => {}
    beforeChangeValue: ({ model, resources metadata, type }) => {}
    afterChangeValue: ({ model, resources metadata, type }) => {}
    afterChangeData: ({ model, resources metadata, type }) => {}
  }
};
```

## Hooks usage

### Access model object

Since the form model object is kept in the Form (class / ui library component), hooks can be used to gain access to the current model object in a specific lifecycle event. 

> **Note:** For `@jafar/react-form` - hooks allow access to the form model object for non-child component, as supposed to child components that gain access using the form's context. The Form component can be located upper in the app's components tree to be supply access via context for more child components other than just the fields components.
Locating the Form component in a higher location can have both advantage and disadvantage. The advantage is that it's data is available for more child component, and disadvantage is that each time the Form is updated and its state is updated - then all child
components are re-rendered and that can hurt performance. This could be improved by using shouldComponentUpdate for child components (like we did with the Field component that only re-renders when the data that it needs was changed). Using hooks to gain access to the form model also has disadvantage that you might keep the data you need also in your app state and thats a duplication of data. So keep in mind that in order to gain access to the form model object sometimes the Form component can be higher and then use the form's context in the child component, and sometimes it can be lower and then use hooks.

### Tracking

Hooks can be used to track changes using the hooks arguments, for example when field value is changed - then the
formId, fieldId and value are available in the `metadata` argument of the before and after hooks.

## During actions hooks

### submit

Function (sync / async) is called during executing [submit action](actions#submit), if the form is valid. Resolves to `true` on success.

```
submit: ({ data, context }) => {}
```

### validate

Function (sync / async) is a form level validator which is called during execution of [submit action](actions#submit) (before calling [submit hook](hooks#submit) - if no
errors).

return `undefined` when form is valid or `errors object` ({ fieldId: [{ name, message }] }) when form is invalid.

```
validate: ({ data, context }) => {}
```

### toDto

Function (sync / async) is called during executing [init action](actions#init) and [changeData action](actions#changedata). Gets initial data (which originally defined in `model.data` - such as data object from the server) and should return new data object that the form will use and manipulate during its lifecycle.

```
toDto: ({ data }) => {} // return new form data
```

### fromDto

Function (sync / async) is called during executing [submit action](actions#submit). Gets form data (current `model.data`) and should return new data object (such as server structure data) that the form will pass to the [submit hook](hooks#submit).

```
fromDto: ({ data }) => {} // return new data to be passed to the submit hook
```

> **Note:** 
> - `toDto` and `fromDto` are not required definitions. You can also perform data conversions on the app level (before sending data to Jafar and after getting data from Jafar). Its just a convenient way to declare all form definitions in a single place.
> - You might be wondering about the different usage between `toDto & fromDto` to `formatter & parser`. Formatters and parsers only manipulate 
field value for the field's component, so only the component gets the formatted value (view value). But sometimes you might want to work on a more
simple data structure during the form lifecycle (if the app data / server data was with complicated structure), such as in validators, excludeTerms, disableTerns and more form handlers. Fot that user `toDto & fromDto`

### isEmpty

Function (sync) determines if a field is considered empty. Its called during:
1. Field validations - evaluates on `init`, `changeValue`, `changeData` actions.
2. Change value - during `changeValue` action, a value is unset from the form data object if its empty, otherwise sets to the data object.
3. [empty](term#empty) term evaluation - evaluates on `init`, `changeValue`, `changeData` actions (only if default `empty` term was not overridden, and if `empty` term was defined to one of the fields in either one of the terms such as `excludeTerm`, `disableTerm` and `requireTerms`).

```
isEmpty: ({ id, value, dependencies: { id: { value } } }) => {}
```

By default - returns true for `undefined`, `null`, `''`, `[]` and `{}` values.

> **Note:** Some system treat only `undefined` as an empty value. We strongly believe that any 'lake of data' should be considered empty
and should be unset from the form's data object. Anyway this logic can be overridden.

### emptyMessage

Function (sync) represent a `required` error message. Its called during field validation - evaluates on `init`, `changeValue`, `changeData` actions. If a field is empty and required, a required error (with message) is set to the field's errors, using this function's return value.

```
emptyMessage: ({ id, value, label, dependencies: { id: { value, label } } }) => {}
```

By default - returns `Field invalid` message.

## Before / after actions hooks

### beforeInit

```
beforeInit: ({ model, resources metadata, type }) => {}
```

```
afterInit: ({ model, resources metadata, type }) => {}
```

### beforeDestroy

```
beforeDestroy: ({ model, resources metadata, type }) => {}
```

### afterDestroy

Function (sync / async) is called after executing `destroy` action

```
afterDestroy: ({ metadata, type }) => {}
```

### beforeChangeData

Function (sync / async) is called before executing `changeData` action

```
beforeChangeData: ({ model, resources metadata, type }) => {}

```
afterChangeData: ({ model, resources metadata, type }) => {}

```
afterChangeUi: ({ model, resources metadata, type }) => {}
```

## Cross actions hooks

### beforeAction

```

### beforeDataChange

Function (sync / async) is called before executing any one of: `init` / `changeValue` / `changeData` / `reset` actions
